# DFS-BFS-Dijkstra
DFS/BFS/Dijkstra's Search Algorithms for undirected and directed graphs in Python

This is the Portfolio Project for CS 261 Data Structures at Oregon State University.

For an undirected graph there are methods to search use depth first search, breadth first search, as well as a method to detect cycles.
These methods are done using an adjacency list to represet the graph. Each vertex has a list of connected vertices.

For a directed graph there are the same methods as well as an additional method using Dijkstra's algorithm. 
This will return the shortest path to each connected node. 
These methods are done using an adjacency matrix to represent the edges. A value > 0 in the matrix represents a weighted edge between two vertices.
